# London Homicide Project

## Project Background
As a Data Analyst focusing on crime trends in London, I analysed Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) homicide data from 2003 to 2023. The dataset includes details on the date of the homicide, the borough in which it occurred, the victim's demographics (age and gender), the offence type (e.g., murder, manslaughter), weapon types, and the case resolution status. The objective of this analysis was to transform raw data into actionable insights that can support crime prevention strategies, inform public policy, and enhance law enforcement efforts to reduce homicide rates and improve case resolution.

## Executive Summary
This analysis provides a comprehensive look at homicide trends across London, identifying key patterns in offence types, weapon usage, victim demographics, seasonal trends, and geographic hotspots. Key findings include:
  - Declining Homicide Rates: Overall homicide rates have decreased since 2003, though there were notable spikes in 2017 and 2019.
  - Weapon Trends: Knives or sharp implements are the most commonly used weapons, involved in 52% of homicides.
  - Victim Demographics: Males make up 76% of victims, and the 25-35 age group is most affected.
  - Geographic Hotspots: Boroughs like Barking and Dagenham, Croydon, and Bromley exhibit notably high homicide rates.
  - Case Resolution: 94% of homicide cases have been resolved, though 6% remain unsolved.
These insights form the basis for crime prevention strategies, targeted public awareness campaigns, and law enforcement actions to further reduce homicides and improve case resolution rates.

## Insights Deep-Dive
### 1. Trends in Homicide Incidents
  - Homicide Rates: Homicide victims decreased from 216 in 2003 to 109 in 2023, showing a general decline since 2009. However, notable spikes occurred in 2017 (141 victims) and 2019 (153 victims).
  - Seasonal Trends: Homicides occur year-round, but spikes in June and July suggest seasonal fluctuations, potentially linked to warmer months or increased social activity.
  - Offense Types: The majority of homicides (94%) are classified as murder, while manslaughter (5%) and infanticide (1%) make up the remainder. This emphasises the prevalence of intentional acts of violence.
### 2. Weapon Trends
  - Knives or Sharp Implements: 52% of homicides involve knives or sharp objects, highlighting the ongoing knife crime issue in London.
  - Other Weapons: Firearms, blunt objects, and strangulation account for the remaining 48%, with firearms being more common among older victims.
### 3. Victim Demographics
  - Gender: 76% of homicide victims are male, with a significant proportion of male victims being involved in knife-related violence.
  - Age: The 25-35 age group represents the largest proportion (22%) of homicide victims, making this age group particularly vulnerable to violent crime. The 60-64 age group also shows a concerning number of homicides, often related to specific victim vulnerabilities.
### 4. Geographic Hotspots
  - High-Risk Boroughs: Barking and Dagenham, Croydon, and Bromley consistently report higher homicide rates, likely driven by socio-economic factors, gang activity, or drug-related violence.
  - Community Factors: These areas have higher levels of violent crime, suggesting a need for more targeted law enforcement and community engagement efforts.
### 5. Case Resolution
  - High Resolution Rate: 94% of homicide cases are solved, indicating strong police efforts in resolving crimes.
  - Unsolved Cases: 6% of homicide cases remain unsolved, suggesting areas where additional resources could be allocated for cold case investigations.

## Recommendations
### 1. Enhance Public Awareness Campaigns
  - Knife Crime Prevention: Focus public awareness campaigns in high-risk boroughs like Barking and Dagenham and Croydon to educate the public on knife crime prevention, conflict de-escalation, and the consequences of violent behaviour.
  - Domestic Violence Awareness: Launch targeted campaigns promoting domestic violence awareness, as 17% of homicides are linked to domestic abuse.
### 2. Targeted Crime Prevention
  - Youth Engagement Programs: Develop outreach programs targeting young males aged 18-35, who make up a significant portion of homicide victims. These programs should focus on mental health support, conflict resolution, and gang violence prevention.
  - Domestic Violence Interventions: Address domestic abuse-related homicides by providing more resources for victims, such as shelters, legal support, and counseling services.
###3. Geographic Focus
  - Increased Law Enforcement Presence: Strengthen police presence in hotspots like Barking and Dagenham, Croydon, and Bromley. Increase patrols, community engagement, and surveillance efforts to deter violent crime.
  - Community Watch Initiatives: Partner with local organisations to enhance community safety programs, including neighbourhood watch schemes, and encourage public participation in crime prevention.
### 4. Improve Case Resolution
  - Cold Case Investigations: Allocate additional resources to unsolved cases, leveraging advanced forensic technologies and cross-agency collaboration to close open cases.
  - Advanced Forensics: Invest in the latest forensic methods to improve the investigation and resolution of homicides, especially those involving older victims or complex gang-related crimes.

## Key Questions for Stakeholders
  - Seasonal Trends: Should law enforcement increase their focus on summer months (when homicides peak) by intensifying patrols and outreach programs during these periods?
  - Victim Demographics: How can crime prevention efforts be better tailored to address the needs of high-risk age groups, particularly young males and older adults?
  - Geographic Focus: How can resources be more effectively allocated to high-risk boroughs to reduce violent crime and homicide rates in those areas?
  - Case Resolution: What additional measures or resources are needed to improve the resolution of unsolved homicide cases?

## Assumptions and Caveats
  - Data Source: The analysis is based on data from the MPS homicide dataset, and while comprehensive, it may not capture all factors influencing homicide trends, such as regional economic conditions or social influences.
  - Case Resolution Rates: The case resolution rates are based on reported data, and unresolved cases may eventually be solved over time, reflecting a lag in reporting or reclassification.
  - Weapon Data: Weapon type data may not be fully comprehensive, especially in cases where the weapon is a blunt object or when strangulation is the cause of death.
  - Victim Demographics: The analysis focuses on age and gender, but additional socio-economic factors and ethnicity could provide deeper insights into the patterns of homicide.
